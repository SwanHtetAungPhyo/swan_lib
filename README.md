### **Why I Built This**

`Swan_lib` was created to help Go developers handle JWT authentication, CORS, and common API tasks easily when working with `net/http`. I built this because, while working on my own microservice for a portfolio project, I found myself repeating the same code too often. Instead of getting frustrated, I wrote this library to save time, reduce complexity, and focus on the actual business logic.

I haved tested the JWT middleware and I believe also the CORS will work
